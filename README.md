Spread the Sheet

What if Ethereum ran on Google Sheets? That’s exactly what we built. Imagine your spreadsheet as the blockchain: every row is a transaction, every column is security, and MetaMask is your pen to sign it. No gas fees, no confusing RPC calls, no setup headaches - just open your wallet and start sending transactions peer-to-peer like magic.

From there you get:

- 1-second finality.
- Gasless transactions out of the box
- Familiar UX.
- Phantom Smart Contracts with full EVM compatibility.
- Green, zero-maintenance tech backed by Google’s infrastructure.
- Export anywhere (Google, PDF, TXT) for free.
- No ABI.
- Eco-friendly & Low-Cost – Zero maintenance, zero validators, zero CO₂ impact.
- Security & Compliance – global infrastructure, inheriting the security of systems trusted by billions, while aligning with regulatory standards.
- MEV Protection – No front running or hidden costs - fair transactions only.
